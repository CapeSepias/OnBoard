OnBoard
=================

An extensible system to keep track of boards & commissions details, the people appointed to those groups, any legislation they write, and the voting records of each committee member. 

The service is provided as an open source PHP application.

## Installation

We use the same configuration for our PHP applications. To make sure the documentation stays up to date, we maintain it separately. It is available here:
